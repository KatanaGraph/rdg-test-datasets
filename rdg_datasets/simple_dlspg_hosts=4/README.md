This is a partitioned LSPG with format DLSPG3.STPG0.  It is generated by
libgluon/test/create-partitioned-dlspg to be small and simple, but still have nodes,
edges, and properties.

We read the RDG in graph_handle_test.py and validate invariants.

# Generation

    mpirun -n 4 create-partitioned-dlspg

Which will create simple_dlspg_hosts=4 in the current directory.

Because the current (12/19/22) uprev framework only supports numeric graph
versions, we do not include any uprev/migration scripts.
